## Project Description

*A clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engage the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?*

Our project addresses the difficulty of figuring out which plants are best given a user's location, experience, patience level, etc. Normally, it's hard to find the right plant with the amount of options and outside information needed-- our project allows a user to identify a plant that is truly the best for them. Our approach saves the time and energy of searching for an individual's ideal plant, and the project's intended users are anyone intrested in owning and caring for a plant.

## Protoype Summary

*Describe the basic functionality of your prototype. What are the features you were able to implement? What features would you like to implement?*

Our prototype allows the user to navigate through a series of prompts regarding one's zip code, experience with plants, and prefrences toward the kind of plant desired. We would like to implement a greater user-selection analysis, which can encompass all of the data even more effectively and efficiently.
